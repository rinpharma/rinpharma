## The Brian Bole Award of Excellence
Open Source in Pharma proudly presents the **"Brian Bole Award of Excellence"** presented each year at R/Pharma Virtual to recognize outstanding contributions to the open-source ecosystem within the life sciences. This award celebrates the individuals and teams who embody the spirit of open collaboration, drive innovation, and help the community embrace open source for clinical reporting and research.

### Honoring Brian Bole
The award is named in honor of Brian Bole, an innovator and thought leader in the field of healthcare. Brian was working in Open Source over 10 years ago and was a very early adopter of R and Shiny. Brian was a health data scientist for Armus Corp and a former NASA Scientist.

Brian was an inspiration to all that worked with him and accelerated the Open Source space in the life sciences by adopting and accelerating innovation through data science. Brian was a son, husband, and brother and earned a degree in mathematics and a doctorate in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech.

We are excited to honor Brian's legacy with the Brian Bole Award of Excellence from Open Source in Pharma. This award is presented annually in recognition of outstanding achievements by practitioners and open source developers who have made a lasting impression on the field and significant contribution to drive and accelerate Open Source in life Sciences so others can learn, adapt and improve the health of their populations.
