## Current Use Cases
* **Development Support**: Chatbots, ADM, Adam TLF coding standards, general coding support and automation
* **Specification Generation**: Potential for generating specifications from SAPs and study documents to complete the code generation loop
* **Clinical Operations**: 
  - Improving operational efficiency
  - Signal detection for safety monitoring

## Implementation Strategy
* Break problems into manageable pipelines
* Start with proof-of-concepts (POCs)
* Leverage domain knowledge as a key asset

## Technical Challenges
* **Data Privacy**: Major concern with handling sensitive clinical data securely
* **Quality Control**: Issues with traceability, repeatability, and quality control
* **AI Limitations**: Hallucination problems with AI outputs
* **Implementation Issues**: Tendency to over-engineer solutions rather than creating manageable ones

## Organizational Barriers
* **Management Resistance**: Leadership not being on board due to established habits
* **ROI Challenges**: Difficulty demonstrating return on investment
* **Validation Requirements**: Need for repeatability and validation processes
* **Training Needs**: Comprehensive user training required for process changes
* **Job Security Concerns**: Worries about AI-related job displacement

## Regulatory and Compliance Issues
* **Audit Trail**: Maintaining proper audit trails
* **Documentation**: Ensuring complete documentation and transparency of AI pathways
* **Quality Standards**: Meeting industry quality standards
* **Data Governance**: Implementing proper guardrails and controls on sensitive data
